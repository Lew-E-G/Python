## Introduction
This repository serves as a showcase of small Python projects that are designed to be run in the terminal/command line. Each project is standalone and focuses on a specific problem or concept, making it easy to learn and adapt.

## Projects Overview
Here are the Python projects included in this collection:

- **Project 1**: `TaskList.py` – A terminal task list with a menu allowing the user to manipulate entries  
- **Project 2**: `banking.py` – A bank interface that lets the user withdraw and deposit money  
- **Project 3**: `countdown_timer.py` – A simple countdown timer  
- **Project 4**: `guessing_game.py` – A game where the user has 3 attempts to guess a random number, receiving feedback on higher or lower  
- **Project 5**: `word_counter.py` – A program that counts the number of words in a document and how many times each word appears
